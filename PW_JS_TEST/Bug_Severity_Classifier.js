-//As a QA engineer, classify bugs based on two
    //  factors: frequency ("always", "often", "rarely")
    //  and impact ("blocker", "major", "minor"). Write a JavaScript
    //  program using nested if-else that prints the bug severity level.

    //Classification Matrix:
    //- always + blocker → P0 | always + major → P1 | always + minor → P2
    //- often + blocker → P1 | often + major → P2 | often + minor → P3
    //- rarely + blocker → P2 | rarely + major → P3 | rarely + minor → P4
