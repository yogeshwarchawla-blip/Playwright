//**Write a program that classifies a triangle based on its side lengths.
//  Given three input values representing the lengths of the sides,
//  determine if the triangle is equilateral (all sides are equal),
//  isosceles (exactly two sides are equal), or scalene (no sides are equal). 
// Use an if-else statement to classify the triangle
